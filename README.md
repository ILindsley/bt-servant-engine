# ü§ñ bt-servant-engine

An AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for Bible translators, now powered by **Meta's Cloud API** (no more Twilio!). The assistant uses FastAPI, OpenAI, and ChromaDB to answer Bible translation questions in multiple languages.

## üß† How the Decision Graph Works (brain.py)
The decision graph below defines the flow of a Bible translation assistant that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to respond to user messages intelligently and faithfully. Each node represents a distinct step in the processing pipeline, and transitions between them are determined either linearly or conditionally based on user input and system state.

**Nodes making LLM API calls*

## üîÑ Node Summaries
- **determine_query_language_node:** Detects the language of the user's message to support multilingual responses and select the appropriate document collection. 
- **preprocess_user_query_node:** Clarifies the user's message using past conversation context, correcting ambiguity and minor issues while preserving intent.
- **determine_intent_node:** Classifies the user's message into one or more predefined intents (e.g., ask a Bible question, change response language, etc.).
- **set_response_language_node:** Updates the user's preferred response language in persistent storage.
- **query_db_node:** Searches relevant ChromaDB document collections using the transformed query, applying a relevance filter to determine if results are useful.
- **query_open_ai_node:** Uses OpenAI (with context from RAG results and chat history) to generate a response. Conditional logic routes long responses to chunking.
- **chunk_message_node:** If the assistant's response exceeds the 1500-character limit imposed by WhatsApp, this node semantically chunks the message into smaller parts.
- **translate_responses_node:** Translates the assistant's final output into the user‚Äôs preferred language, if needed.
- **handle_unsupported_function_node**, **handle_unclear_intent_node**, and **handle_unrelated_information_request_node:** Graceful fallback nodes triggered when the system can't determine the user's intent, the function is unsupported, the question is off-topic, or the user is asking about how the system works.
- **handle_system_information_request_node:** This node handles user questions about the assistant itself ‚Äî such as what it can do, how it works, or what resources it uses. When this intent is detected, the system loads a predefined system prompt that frames the assistant as a helpful RAG-based servant to Bible translators. The assistant uses this context to generate a response strictly limited to the help docs.

## üöÄ Environment Setup

This app uses a `.env` file for local development.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup (Local)

1. **Create a `.env` file**

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

2. **Edit your `.env`**

Fill in the required values:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-verify-token-here
META_WHATSAPP_TOKEN=your-meta-access-token-here
META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-meta-phone-number-id
BASE_URL=https://your.public.domain
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_IJ...
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All five above variables are required for the Meta Cloud API to work properly.

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
uvicorn bt_servant:app --reload
```

## üåê Environment Variables Explained

| Variable               | Purpose                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`       | Auth token for OpenAI's GPT models                              |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`       | Auth token for Groq models                                      |
| `META_VERIFY_TOKEN`    | Custom secret used for Meta webhook verification                |
| `META_WHATSAPP_TOKEN`  | Access token used to send messages via Meta API                 |
| `META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Phone number ID tied to Meta app/WABA                           |
| `BASE_URL`      | Public base URL used to generate audio file links               |
| `BT_SERVANT_LOG_LEVEL` | (Optional) Defaults to info log level if not present            |
| `IN_META_SANDBOX_MODE` | (Optional) Set to true when testing in sandbox mode             |
| `META_SANDBOX_PHONE_NUMBER` | Only accept requests from this phonenumber when testing locally |

Other acceptable values for log level: critical, error, warning, and debug

## üõ∞ Webhook Setup

Set your webhook URL in the [Meta Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/) under your WhatsApp App configuration:

- **Callback URL**: `https://<your-domain>/meta-whatsapp`
- **Verify Token**: Must match `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` in your `.env`

---

## üì§ Sending Messages via Meta Cloud API

When a user sends a WhatsApp message to your number, Meta calls your `/meta-whatsapp` endpoint. This app currently echoes back the received message. All message logic is defined in `bt_servant.py`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

- If audio URLs don‚Äôt resolve, double-check `BASE_URL`
- If Meta webhook verification fails, confirm `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches what you entered in the Meta console

---

## üß™ Testing Locally

You can test message flow locally using tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose `localhost:8000` to the public internet, then set your webhook in Meta to use the `https://<ngrok-url>/meta-whatsapp` endpoint.
